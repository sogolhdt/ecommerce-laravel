## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).


## Ecommerce Project
this is a laravel backend project for the 1ta100 company's interview. 

The project contains of two sections:
-Products : defining new products and sending email to the manangement when it's done

-Shopping cart : adding and removing  products to the cart

the projects works both when user is logged in or logged out, If they're logged in the cart information is gonna store in the database which makes it maitainable after logging out and logging back in

if there's no user logged in the cart's data will store in the session and it  still maintains after each browser refresh,
and at last, if user logs in the cart related data from the session will transfer to the user's cart
